<p>Additionally, TSMC plans to introduce more advanced packaging technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPO (Co-Packaged Optics)</strong>: Integrating optical components with chips to improve data transmission efficiency</li>
<li><strong>FOPLP (Fan-Out Panel-Level Packaging)</strong>: Using panel-level processes to reduce costs and increase capacity</li>
</ul>
<p>These technologies will ensure TSMC&#39;s core position in the AI chip ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Global Expansion Strategy</h2>
<p>TSMC is actively expanding its global footprint to meet global customer demands and diversify geopolitical risks.</p>
<h3>Overseas Expansion Plans</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arizona, USA</strong>: Building advanced process wafer fabs</li>
<li><strong>Japan</strong>: Expanding capacity to meet local customer demands</li>
<li><strong>Germany</strong>: Building new wafer fabs to serve the European market</li>
</ul>
<h3>Challenges and Opportunities</h3>
<p>While overseas expansion helps diversify risks, it also faces some challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rising Costs</strong>: Overseas fab construction costs are higher than in Taiwan, which may impact gross margins</li>
<li><strong>Power Costs</strong>: Rising global power costs are putting pressure on operating costs</li>
<li><strong>Geopolitical Risks</strong>: Need to balance capacity allocation across different regions</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite this, TSMC remains optimistic about its growth prospects, expecting continued healthy growth driven by AI demand.</p>
<h2>Market Outlook and Investment Opportunities</h2>
<h3>Industry Growth Expectations</h3>
<p>According to Counterpoint Research&#39;s report, the AI wave has ignited demand for advanced semiconductor processes. <strong>Global foundry industry output is expected to grow 20% year-over-year in 2025</strong>, and TSMC, as the industry leader, is expected to outperform the industry average growth rate.</p>
<h3>Analyst Forecasts</h3>
<p>Stifel&#39;s research report indicates:</p>
<ul>
<li>TSMC maintains its 2025 capital expenditure plan, with a median year-over-year growth of <strong>34%</strong></li>
<li>Raised 2025 revenue growth forecast from <strong>20%</strong> to <strong>30%</strong></li>
<li>Mainly driven by AI and high-performance computing (HPC) sectors</li>
